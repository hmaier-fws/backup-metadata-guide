# Individual Contacts

Before creating a new individual contact, please check the Alaska regional master contact list to reduce duplication of contacts.&#x20;

1. Click the plus (![](<../.gitbook/assets/symbol\_plus\_16 (1).png>)) sign by **Contacts**.
2. Specify the contact is an **Individual**.
3. The **Contact ID** will be auto-generated by mdEditor.

_The following fields are available for **Individual Contacts:**_

* **Individual Name** (Required): Enter individual's full name If you are entering a generic contact for a specific position, you can enter a Position Name without entering an Individual Name. For example: you could enter Region 3 Data Manager as a Position Name rather than an Individual Name.
* **Position Name**: Enter individual's full title avoiding acronyms for clarity. If you have entered the individual's name, the Position Name is not required, but is a best practice.
* **Contact Type** (Required): Select the contact type from the picklist.  Contact type allows for search and identification of collaborative projects and products.
* **Member Organization** (Required): Select an organization(s). An individual may be part of multiple organizations.  For example, Homer Simpson is a refuge manager; his member organizations may include Springfield National Wildlife Refuge and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska region.  Because the former is a member of the National Wildlife Refuge System and the later is a member of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, these will also be including in Homer's contact metadata upon export.
* **Phone Number**: Enter an office phone number
* **Email Address** (Required): Enter individual's email
* **Address**: Enter a physical address for the organization's office.
* **Online Resource:**  Individual online resources include professional online resources for the individual.  For example, an[ OrcID](https://orcid.org/) (Open Researcher and Contributor ID) identifier, a professional individual weblink for a staff page or research lab page, or[ LinkedI](https://www.linkedin.com/)n  profile can be added as an online resource. &#x20;
* **Logo:**  Individual contacts inherit the logo from their member organization.
* **Available Time:** Add times when available, if applicable.
