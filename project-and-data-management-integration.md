# Project & Data Management Integration

Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to oversee a project to completion in the desired time and to a specified quality.  Data management is concerned with the handling of data to ensure long-lasting integrity and usability.  Despite the fundamental difference, project management and data management life cycles work in tandem!
