  Instructions on how to enter required dictionary metadata fields based on the
  Alaska Regional Profile in mdEditor
---

# Dictionary Main Tab

The Main tab includes the primary metadata fields for a dictionary.

## Basic Information

### Dictionary ID (Required, auto-generated)

### Title (Required)

Enter a concise, yet informative title. Good titles, when they appear in a search, will be informative and understandable.  Consider adding location, species, season, survey type or method, and dates.  For example: Japanese Mutant Ninja Turtle Nest Locations in North Bay, Japan 1985-1991

### Subject (Required)

The **Subject** drop-down menu allows you to describe the scope or content of the information in the dictionary. This will most likely be _tabularDataset_.

### Responsible Party (Required)

Adding a point of contact gives users information on who to contact should they have a question regarding the dictionary. To add contacts to a Dictionary Record, you must first create/upload the contacts into mdEditor. See the Contact Section for more information.

{% hint style="info" %}
A Master contacts list is maintained in the top level 'contacts' folder of the RDR.  This is maintained by the Alaska program managers and contains staff contacts and common organizational contacts. Before starting and editing metadata records in mdEditor, import the mdJSON contacts file.

If you need to add a contact to this master list, please contact your data manager.&#x20;
