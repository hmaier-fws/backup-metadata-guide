# Guide to Good Titles

### Introduction&#x20;

The FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) require descriptive titles to improve data discovery. Titles should include where/what/when/who. The National Migratory Bird Program (MBP) developed these title guidelines for staff use.  Titles may include the location, species, data collection method, time of year, and survey year(s). Information about who is included in the organization, region, and partners fields.&#x20;

### Creating descriptive Title with examples:

Most data assets represent observations, but there is a significant subset with habitat data. The naming rules for the two types of assets differ.  Below is a guide to how descriptive words can be arranged to create a descriptive title.&#x20;

### Order of words in a title for observation assets:   &#x20;

**Legend:**  Orientation – Location(s) – Locality – Species Status – Species – Season – Methods Descriptors – Date(s)&#x20;

1. Location orientation (if applicable)&#x20;
2. Location(s)\*&#x20;
3. Locality (if applicable)&#x20;
4. Species status (if applicable)&#x20;
5. Species (Common Name or species group)\*&#x20;
6. Season(s) (if applicable)&#x20;
7. Descriptor(s) of methods\* &#x20;
8. Year(s)\*&#x20;

\*Recommended fields

Example titles:&#x20;

\- Alaska Emperor Goose Fall Aerial Survey, 1979-2015&#x20;

\- Kansas and Oklahoma Flint Hills Region Shorebird Spring Migration Roadside Survey, 1999-2019&#x20;

\- Western U.S. and Canada Breeding Double-crested Cormorant Multi-mode Survey, 2014-Present&#x20;

### Order of words in a title for non-observational assets:&#x20;

**Legend:**  Orientation – Location(s) – Locality – Data Descriptors – Data Type – Date(s)&#x20;

1. Location orientation (if applicable)&#x20;
2. Location(s)\*&#x20;
3. Locality (if applicable)&#x20;
4. Data descriptor(s)&#x20;
5. Data type\*&#x20;
6. Date(s)\*&#x20;

\*Recommended fields&#x20;

Title examples: \
\- Nebraska Central Platte River Historical Land Cover Image Library, 1860s&#x20;

### Overview of Title Elements&#x20;

Location orientation&#x20;

Words that describe a specific area within the location should go first in the FAIR title. Examples of these “orientation” adjectives include:&#x20;

* Western&#x20;
* Southeast&#x20;
* Central&#x20;
* Coterminous&#x20;
* Upper&#x20;

Location(s)&#x20;

One or more geographic areas covered by the study. Locations should only be large, well-known countries, states, land formations, or waterways. Examples include:&#x20;

* Alaska&#x20;
* Gulf of Mexico&#x20;
* Rocky Mountain&#x20;
* U.S. and Canada&#x20;

Locality&#x20;

Any further specification of the study area is covered by this group of descriptive words. Locality covers specific places (e.g. Gulf Coast, Otter Lake, Innoko National Wildlife Refuge) as well as general places (e.g. Coastal).&#x20;

Species status&#x20;

The species status field describes the life stage, status, or state of individual birds being observed. Examples include:&#x20;

* Breeding&#x20;
* Molting&#x20;
* Nesting&#x20;
* Satellite-tagged&#x20;
* GPS-tagged&#x20;
* Tagged&#x20;

Common name(s) or species group&#x20;

The most important element to include in a bird-centric FAIR title is the taxon. We include common names for single species data assets but when multiple species are involved, a more general descriptor is used. Subspecies may be specified with their common or regional name. Examples include:&#x20;

* Aleutian Canada Goose&#x20;
* American Common Eider&#x20;
* Colonial Waterbird&#x20;
* Diving Bird&#x20;
* Double-crested Cormorant&#x20;
* Dusky Canada Goose&#x20;
* Sea Duck&#x20;
* Shorebird&#x20;
* Snow Goose&#x20;
* Waterfowl&#x20;

Season(s)&#x20;

When applicable, the time of year should be specified in the FAIR title. Examples include:&#x20;

* Fall&#x20;
* Mid-winter&#x20;
* Spring and Fall&#x20;
* Summer&#x20;

Descriptor(s) of methods&#x20;

A concise description of how the data were collected. Examples include:&#x20;

* Aerial Survey&#x20;
* Census&#x20;
* Ground and Aerial Survey&#x20;
* Mark-Resight Survey&#x20;
* Population Survey&#x20;
* Recruitment Surveys&#x20;
* Satellite Telemetry Study&#x20;

Date(s)&#x20;

Every FAIR title should list the start and end years in which the data were collected. If data collection is ongoing, end year = Present. Examples include:&#x20;

* 1990-2007&#x20;
* 2002-Present&#x20;
* 2005&#x20;
