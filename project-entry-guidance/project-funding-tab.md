# Project Funding Tab

Including funding information in the metadata allows for identification of funding sources and recipients, and enables comparisons, and aggregations across all regions.  **Funding metadata is currently only required for Science Applications projects.** [ **SA metadata guidance**](https://tpatterson.gitbook.io/sametadatacreationguide/) **is available separately.**

## Funding Allocations

Allocations describe where project funding came from, how much, where and when it was distributed. Populating project funding metadata allows users to search by specific fiscal year, funders, or recipients.

A funding allocation represents a single fiscal year, source, and recipient. If you have two recipients in a single fiscal year, each needs to be added as a separate funding allocation.

#### Award ID

The Award ID numbers are internal codes that connect the distribution forms to the project metadata. Award IDs include grant or cooperative agreement numbers, contract numbers, or inter-agency agreement numbers. Inclusion of Award IDs provides accountability and business process tracking.

&#x20;If no Award ID exists, then the project is likely a Service internal effort.  Enter '_None_" in the Award ID field.&#x20;

#### Amount

Enter the amount of funding.  Be sure U.S.D. is selected (Unites States of America Dollar).

#### Source

Add the relevant contact for the “source” of the project funding. Source should be an organization, not an individual. For regional FWS projects, the funding source should be U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Alaska Region.  Collaborative projects where funding is distributed from another agency i.e., Bureau of Land Management or Bureau of Reclamation, may contain multiple distributions with varying funding sources.&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Funding source should always identify the agency or organization, rather than a sub-program or office. For example, all funding from other FWS programs need to list U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the source, not Fisheries, specific Refuges, Ecological Services, etc.. Clarifications on the exact program or office where the funding came from should be done through the Funding/Other Contacts field with the administrator role.
{% endhint %}

#### Recipient

Add the relevant organizational contact for the “recipient” of the project funding. Recipient should always be an organization, not an individual. For example, the Principal Investigator would not be listed as the recipient, but their organization would be. If there are multiple recipients for a project, separate allocations need to be created for each.

#### Other Contacts

In most cases, a program or region has allocated the funding for a project.  In order to track funds within regions and programs and provide proper credit, add the FWS program as the funding "administrator".  For example, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service can be identified as the funding source and the funding administrator may also include "Seaduck Joint Venture" or a specific field office like Togiak National Wildlife Refuge.

You may add the Principal Investigator with the "principalInvestigator" role to identify the person within the recipient organization responsible for the project. &#x20;

#### Designated Funding Source Tracking

In some cases, funds are marked for specific activities and include reporting requirements that accompany the funding allocations.  For example, EPA allocates Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funds on behalf of Congress to FWS, among others.  FWS then distributes the funds across programs for use. Oil spill restoration funds are a similar case. This funding flow can be tracked and aggregated within Other Contacts listed in an allocation.  Add an organization as the contact and add "_funder_" as the role in Other Contacts.

#### FWS sub-activity, funding codes, agreement type

Sub-activity, funding code, or agreement type codes may be included in the Allocation comments.  For example, the text entry may look like this:  FWS sub-activity 1420, fundcode 190, contract.  If funds are provided from multiple sub-activities, add these in the description in series.  For example, FWS sub-activity 1430, fundcode 170, $30,000: sub-activity 1420, fundcode 170, $10,000.&#x20;

#### Matching and In-kind Funds

Project funds or in-kind support that were supplied by a partner may be included as an allocation as described above, but the matching fund box should be checked. Each matching fund provider should be included as a separate allocation.

## Time Period

#### Dates

For each allocation, enter the fiscal year that funds were awarded (not the time span of the entire project). There should be a single fiscal year for each allocation. Adding a time period lets users know what Fiscal Year the project was funded.

{% hint style="info" %}
Use the “Pick a Fiscal Year” dropdown to autofill the date fields.
