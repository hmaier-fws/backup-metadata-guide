# Project Distribution Tab

### **Distribution**

Distribution provides documentation on how or where users can obtain the data products.  Distribution methods may include online options (e.g., website, database) or offline options (e.g., delivery via email, snail mail, or a library).  Multiple distributions may be added when data products are shared broadly.

#### The Alaska Regional Data Repository project folder location should be added as a distribution.  &#x20;

See Product Distribution Tab for additional guidance.
