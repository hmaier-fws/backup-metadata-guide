# I Need HELP! and Bug Reporting

## Where to Get Help

There are a lot of new concepts introduced here. There are also many steps involved in writing metadata for a project and its products and managing that metadata in the archive folder. There are a few good places to look for answers or ask questions.

1. This guide is a partner guide to the [Alaska Region Interim Data Management User Guide](https://ak-region-dst.gitbook.io/alaska-region-interim-data-management-user-guide/).
2. Visit the [Alaska Data Management Sharepoint site](https://doimspp.sharepoint.com/sites/fws-FF07S00000-data/SitePages/Alaska-Region-Data-Management.aspx).
3. The [Alaska Data Forum discussion](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aDOALAy1dGUC9Hf2LrdHW8tyL438XvRuD4h3SeMCOnzQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=30e71f75-c08f-484a-b64a-f08f4e3af34f\&tenantId=0693b5ba-4b18-4d7b-9341-f32f400a5494) on AK data forum team site.

## Bug Reporting

mdEditor is undergoing constant development. If you think there is a bug in the program, this can be reported at [https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues](https://github.com/adiwg/mdEditor/issues) or brought to the attention of your DST member. This is not the location to ask questions about the processes outlined here.&#x20;
