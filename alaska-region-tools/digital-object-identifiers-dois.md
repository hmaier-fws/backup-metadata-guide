# Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs)

DOIs, or digital object identifiers, are alphanumeric strings used to identify digital resources and ease distribution of project data and deliverables. Each DOI is unique and persistent, serving as a stable link individuals can always use to access a particular resource.

## Structure of a DOI

DOIs have a standardized structure with a prefix and suffix separated by a slash (/). The prefix usually takes the form 10.NNNN, where NNNN represents any four-digit number greater than or equal to 1000. The DOI’s suffix is a alphanumeric string that identifies a single object.

## Creating a DOI

DOIs can be minted for a project or finalized product using the Service’s [DOI Management Tool](https://www1.usgs.gov/fws/doi/#/). Once a DOI is created, it is permanent and cannot be unpublished. However, the landing page URL associated with the DOI can be altered.
