# Product Associated Tab

The **Associated** section is used to connect metadata records with each other. This feature should be used when items are related. For example, products are often the result of projects, and projects can have sub-projects. Projects and products can be linked together by using association.&#x20;

Associating product records with a project is the same process as the project associations.  [See Project Associated Tab](broken-reference) or review instruction below.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Associations can only be made after both project and product records have been created in mdEditor.
{% endhint %}

**Step 1**: Select "**parentProject**" from the **Association Type** drop-down menu. This field will describe the relationship from the associated record to the product record (the associated record is the parentProject of the product record you are editing).&#x20;

**Step 2**: Click the "**Select a Record"** button to select an associated project.&#x20;
