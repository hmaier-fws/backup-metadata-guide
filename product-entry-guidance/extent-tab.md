# Product Extent Tab

**Extent** refers to the location or geographic boundaries for your dataset. Spatial extents lets users see at a glance the geographic footprint of your data and enables searching within specific geographic areas.

Spatial extents should be included for all products, as applicable. As a default, products may inherit extents from their project.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Tip: You can export, save, and import an extent to use for other projects or products.
{% endhint %}

For further information on Extents, see the Project Metadata Guidance for the [Project Extent Tab](../project-entry-guidance/extent-tab.md).
