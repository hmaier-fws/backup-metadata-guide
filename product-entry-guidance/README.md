# Product Metadata Guidance

The Product Entry Guidance section covers how to create a metadata record for a product.  A product can be anything from a dataset to a document or presentation to program script or model. mdEditor offers an extensive list of product options, of which "_product_" should never be used.&#x20;

## Before You Begin

### Adjust your mdEditor Settings, as needed:

### Select the Product Profile:

After creating your product record initially and before you begin editing metadata, select a profile.   **Product** may be chosen from the **Profile** drop down in the main menu.  A profile limits the available tabs and only shows tabs that contain fields that are required for product creation. Additionally, often a profile also limits the fields from view for a specific type of metadata record--in this case a product record.  For example, funding is not needed for a product and this tab is hidden.&#x20;

### **Update your contacts in mdEditor, as needed:** <a href="#make-sure-your-contacts-are-loaded-into-mdeditor" id="make-sure-your-contacts-are-loaded-into-mdeditor"></a>

In mdEditor, contacts are created separately from individual records, and then stored within a contact library. Once contacts have been entered or imported into mdEditor, they can be used in any metadata records.  The Alaska region maintains a master contact list for import that can be found in a file folder in the top level of the [Regional Data Repository](broken-reference).  See [Contact Entry Guidance](broken-reference).
