### **Distribution (Required)**

Distribution provides documentation on how or where users can obtain the data products.  Distribution methods may include online options (e.g., website, database) or offline options (e.g., delivery via email, snail mail, or a library).  Multiple distributions may be added when data products are shared broadly.

#### The Alaska Regional Data Repository project folder location should be added as a distribution, as applicable.  &#x20;

### Online Option (Required if Available)

#### Name

The Name of the online resource should be something that indicates it is a product page where the data can be downloaded. Examples: "product webpage" or "Product Webpage with Downloadable Files." If there are multiple files for a single product record, the Name should be different for each file so the user can differentiate between them. For example, "Download Aguiguan Veg 2016 data" or "Download FDM Veg 2011 data."

{% hint style="info" %}
Use unique names for datasets that will be sent to data.gov. Without a name, the link will display as "webpage."  This or identical names for different datasets are not informative.
{% endhint %}

#### URI

The most important thing to enter is the URL where the product can be accessed or downloaded.

Add the URI for the distribution.  For the RDR, enter the url for the project's archive folder.  For example, the RDR folder location for the Migratory Bird Management land bird project on Red Knots is 'https:\\\ifw7ro-file.fws.doi.net\datamgt\mbm\mbmlb_003\__RedKnot'.

The format of the online link must start with **https:\\\\** A unintelligible error message will occur otherwise.

{% hint style="danger" %}
